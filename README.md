### Encrypt and decrypt text with AES algorithm :zap:
####:closed_lock_with_key: Encription modes: 128bit, 192bit & 256bit.
####:key: Shows the result of encryption in base64.  
#
### How secure it is?
_AES encryption is used by U.S. for securing sensitive but unclassified material, so we can say it is enough secure. :envelope:_
#
### How to use it?
_If you want to encrypt a text put it in the white textarea above, set the key of the encryption then push the Encrypt button.  
The result of the encryption will appear in base64 encoded to prevent character encoding problems.  
If you want to decrypt a text be sure it is in base64 encoded and is encrypted with AES algorithm!  
Put the encrypted text in the white textarea, set the key and push the Decrypt button._
